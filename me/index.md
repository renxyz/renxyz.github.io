# Hello! 


My name is meixiangru & I am an Engineer with an aptitude & affinity for bench science, lab design & software.




When I actually think to do it, I also enjoy taking [photos](https://renxyz.github.io/me/).

                
I seldom [tweet](https://renxyz.github.io/me/), but it's the perfect way to get a hold of me.
